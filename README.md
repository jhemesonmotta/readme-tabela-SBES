|Product |Lost time|a quarter of developers’ working time is wasted and that additional code analysis and technical debt are the biggest cause of this [10].|0.5|
|Product |Number / frequency of commits| Helie et al. [11] used as one of the factors related to productivity, the frequency of code commits in an hour interval. According to the authors, a high number means (according to empirical knowledge) that more work is being done.|0.4|

|Organization|Code reuse |the reuse of code, libraries or even functionality is a factor that positively impacts productivity in software development [1].|1.195|
|Organization|Maturity |it is one of the factors that most positively affects productivity and requires a team with effective communication; high adaptability; conflict management skills; shared decision-making; cohesion; mutual trust; behavioral compliance; clear responsibilities; and shared responsibilities [14].|1.195|
|Organization|Use of best practices in software project management|practices that support the construction of a work environment that favors the commitment and interest of team members are factors of positive impact on productivity [1].|1.15 |
|Organization|Merits and rewards system|these systems contribute positively to the productivity of the development team [1].|1.098|
|Organization|Accuracy of information|the accuracy of the information that reaches the development team (such as bug reports, use cases and change requests) influences its productivity [15]|1.098|
|Organization|Team autonomy level|It subjectively represents the extent to which the software team has authority and control in making decisions to carry out the project \cite{chapettaT20}.|1.073|
|Organization|Stakeholder participation in development|in general it affects productivity positively, however, care must be taken because, if excessive, this participation can be negative [1].|1.07 |

|Organization|Development site |studies indicate that the location of development affects productivity (for example: different countries, military or industrial organizations, etc.) [1].|0.93 |
|Organization|Sharing members between projects|resource sharing between projects is negative in the context of productivity as developers have to keep different contexts in mind [1].|0.829|
|Organization|Innovative mindset |the existence of a mindset that is always open to new ideas influences the productivity of software developers [4].|0.829|
|Organization|Iteration length|The length of an iteration in days, calculated as the time elapsed between the start and end dates of the iteration, can affect productivity \cite{scottCP20}.|0.756|

|OSS |Application complexity |factor also related to the Product, applies even more to open source software projects because a modularized architecture without complexity makes it easier for other people to contribute to the project, thus making it more productive [17].|0.82 |
|OSS |User base|it is natural for developers to be more interested in contributing to open source software projects with a larger user base [17].|0.64 |
